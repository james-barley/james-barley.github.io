        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>    

        <ol> 
            
           <li><h3>Getting blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    
            problem was my function would not work. <br>
            Used lots of problem solving mostly error messgae then google that. <br>
            I was Very frustrated as I thought I had completed the task and it wasn’t giving me the pass. <br>
            I learned how key it is to have an eye for detail as I had camel cased on the original function but didn’t when I was calling the function leading to an error.
            I need to make sure my code is perfect down to the last detail.
            </li> 
            
            <li><h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
            
            If I’m honest I don’t think I have solved any of my coding problems elegantly so far. Most have been from extensive goggling or from just trying lots of things and eventually it works.
            Though I am striving for this to happen regularlly everytime I attempt a new problem.  <br>
               


            <li><h3>Problem solving techniques</h3></li>


            pseudocoding: I started using it a bit and think it is a good practise to get into but still working on how to integrate it with my learning. <br> <br>

            Try something: I do this alot but there’s only so much you can do before you get stuck. <br> <br>

            Reading error messages: was helpful as it would tell you the line or the function so is was good to key point exactly where in your code I was going wrong. <br> <br>

            Console.logging: It's very helpful but I not confident exactly when to use it but when I have got it right it has been great. <br> <br>

            Googling: Google is my best friend and I am finding I am getting better at asking the right question as I gain more context and knowledge in java script. <br> <br>

            Asked my facilitator: I have asked for help a bit and Rose is very helpful getting be to work it out myself but steering me in the right direction when I’m super stuck. Shout out Rose :). <br> <br>

            Reflect: I like to look back at previous coding I have done if it is similar to what im working on as it is helpful to find that previous solution used in a new context which is great for cementing my learning. <br>
