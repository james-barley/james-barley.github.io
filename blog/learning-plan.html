    <h1>Leanring Plan</h1>    


 <ul>
    
    <li><H3>What is your long term goal?</h3>

    I want to become a front end web developer.

    <li><H3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</H3>

        I think that I can be an over thinker and this slows me down as I over think and go through things multiple times. This can lead to procrastination. Though it helps me in the long run as I process things throughly.

    <li><H3>Non-technical skills  I would you like to see developed in myself while at EDA?</H3>

        A weakness of mine is my time management so working on that would be a really key factor to determine my success at EDA. I also want to improve my eye for detail and working with code you need this so is a great chance for me to improve.

    <li><H3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </H3>
        I am committed to manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. Also strong communication on where I am at with projects especially if they effect others. Hold myself accountable to the time lines of the course and if things build up communicate this.Also communicate any outside commitments so peers know the exspectation of me.

    <li><H3>Expectation of Facilitators </H3>
            I expect the facilitator team to guide and help me when I require it in a timely manner.

  </ul>
