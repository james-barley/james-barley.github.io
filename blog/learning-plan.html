     <h1>Leanring Plan</h1>    


     <ul>
    
        <li><H3>What is your long term goal?</h3>

        I want to become a front end web developer.

        <li><H3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</H3>

        I think that I can be an over thinker and this slows me down as I over think and go through things multiple times. This can lead to procrastination. Though it helps me in the long run as I process things throughly.

        <li><H3>Non-technical skills  I would you like to see developed in myself while at EDA?</H3>

        A weakness of mine is my time management so working on that would be a really key factor to determine my success at EDA. I also want to improve my eye for detail and working with code you need this so is a great chance for me to improve.

        <li><H3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </H3>
        I am committed to manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. Also strong communication on where I am at with projects especially if they effect others. Hold myself accountable to the time lines of the course and if things build up communicate this.Also communicate any outside commitments so peers know the exspectation of me.

        <li><H3>Expectation of Facilitators </H3>
            I expect the facilitator team to guide and help me when I require it in a timely manner.

       </ul>

               <h1>Boot Camp Leanring Plan</h1>    <br>

            <ul>

                <li><H3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</H3>

                I want to become a front end developer that eventually can free lance my skills and help people create amazing websites for passion projects and businesses.
                
                
                <li><H3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</H3>
                
                I think I thrive in a peer to peer learning environment connecting with others and talking through ideas am looking forward being able to have teachings that not just online.
                2 weakness I have that I’ve been working on over the last couple years is my time management and my eye for detail. So staying on top of my projects and to keep sharpening my eye for detail is very key for me.
                
                
                <li><H3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</H3>
                
                That will be my time management just being conscious of due dates and being productive in my elected study times.
                
                
                <li><H3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</H3>
                
                My eye for detail is a skill I’m want to see developed  and is much need when coding so this is a great opportunity to develop this skill.
                
                
                <li><H3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</H3>
                
                My expectation is that they will help me when I ask of it and that they will keep me accountable in my learning so I can get the most out of the course.
                
                <li><H3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</H3>
                That I am fully committed to prioritising my learning over the next 9 weeks and put my best effort forward.
