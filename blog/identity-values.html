    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>    

    <ol> 
        
       <li><h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>

        Looking at my core values they come from my upbring, faith and experiences. <br>
        My upbring I have taken on values that my parents hold some of these are integrity, working hard and helping poeple.
        In my faith one of the key messages is love your neigbour as yourself and that's somthing I strive to do in my daily life.
        Then there is values I'm figuring out through experience and seeing what I value as I grow older such as humility and kindess.
        
        </li> 
        
        <li><h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
        
        One of my strengths is a great team member that can get along with anyone.
        Another is my curiosity and critical thinking which have helped me a lot in my development.
        Limitations have been my time management skills and may eye for detail which have slowly been improving, which I know it is a weakness of mine. <br>
        
        I think my curiosity will aid me very well in this course to keep motivation high when I come to a difficult obstacle.<br>
