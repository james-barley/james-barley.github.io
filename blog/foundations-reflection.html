      <h1>Foundation Reflection</h1>   

       <ul>
        
       <li><h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h3>


        I can be too hard on myself when my learning isn’t going to plan.
        Managing my anxiety when it becomes intense.
        Learning mindfulness and putting time aside for that really helps


        <li><h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </h3>

        I think these determine how you attack your learning, they determine your attitude, how you see yourself and others and the pressure you out on yourself.
        Like I have a lot of empathy for others but not myself and is something I need too extend myself when in the learning space.



        <li><h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning? </h3>
        I think it was the mindfulness, I’ve read a lot of books about successful people and mindfulness is something they all had in common. Foundations was a great opportunity to start this practice and found it really helped me.

        <li><h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? </h3>
        Most of the learnings I’ve heard before in podcasts or articles online but it was great to have a medium to really practice these concepts as I learned coding.
        The most challenging was being consistent with them like remembering to practice mindfulness each day or growth mindset when I was facing a difficult coding challenge.

        <li><h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </h3>
        I think because becoming a developer is more about continuous learning than just knowing a programming language. This is just the start of our journey and if you equip us with methods to learn all languages rather than just teach us java script it is better for our development in the long run.


        <li><h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        I think personally as I struggle with the programming aspect and have read and learned about most of the core concepts before this course it might have been more beneficial for me just to straight cram code. 
        But it’s great to learn all these core teaching in context of programming.
