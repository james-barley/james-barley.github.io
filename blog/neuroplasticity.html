      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>    


      <ul>

        <li><H3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</H3>

         I think that when people know how something works they are able to get the best out of it, so if you understand how your brain works you will learn better and faster
        
        <li><H3> Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</H3>
        
          I will be visualising things a lot more than I would so I not just getting learnings when I siting down and doing it but also while I dedicate time to thinking about it also.
        
        <li><H3>hat are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</H3>

          Playing video games, learning a musical instrument and learning a new language are a few ways to increase neuroplasticity

        <li><H3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</H3>

      </ul>

          
          <h1>Mindset</h1>

          <ul>
            <li><H3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</H3>
            
               It is the ability to be confident and positive when overcoming obstacles you may face when learning something new or developing a new skill. Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination. By changing the way you think, you can change the way you learn
            
              <li><H3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</H3>
            
               I have had past experience of failing to learn because of my mindset and see how valuable growth mindset is when learning. I think what changed is not being so hard on myself when I am slow to learn new things. 
            
            <li><H3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</H3>
            
              Be confident that it will come and give myself more grace when the learning doesn’t come quickly or as fast as I’d like it.
            
            
            <li><H3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</H3>

            <li><h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy </h3>
            
                It gives me more strategies to learning and equips myself with a better understanding to get the best out of coming against obstles when I learn.
              
          </ul>
