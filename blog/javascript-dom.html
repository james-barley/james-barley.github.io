    <h1>Javascript & the Dom</h1>    


    <ul>

        <li><H3>An analogy of HTML and CSS</H3>

HTML holds all the content like the structure of a house and the shape and CSS is the interior designer it changes the colours the fonts and every design aspect on the page.


<li><H3>Control Flow</H3>

The control flow is the order in which we do things if I want to put on my shoe I need my sock on first and my shoe before thinking about doing up my laces.
Loops in control flow are processes where the instructions need to repeat until a certain condition is met


<li><H3>The DOM </H3>

The DOM (Document object model) is an interface to interact with web pages.
We use the Dom to add, remove and change content on our web pages.


<li><H3>Arrays & objects</H3>

They are types of different groupings, arrays is for when the variables are all the same type such as different ages or names and objects is when you want a grouping of lot of different types of variables.

<li><H3>Functions</H3>

A function is a set of statements that performs a task. 
It takes into account variables and pushes out another variable.
